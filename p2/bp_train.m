% Train a network with one hidden layer using back propagation.
%
% Parameters:
%   - Train_set: Matrix containing the training attributes set.
%   - Train_class: Matrix containing the trainging classes.
%   - alpha: Learning rate.
%   - hidden_layer_n: Number of nodes in the hidden layer.
%   - max_ages: Limit of the trainging ages.
%
% Returns:
%   - b: List of matrices representing the bias of each layer.
%   - w: List of matrices representing the weights of each layer.
%   - n_ages: Number of ages of the trainging.
%   - error: Matrix of errors for each age.
%   - ecm: Matrix of mean squared errors for each age.
